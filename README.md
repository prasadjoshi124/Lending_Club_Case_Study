# Lending Case Study 
### Objective of the analysis 

This Case study start with lending loans to applicants. lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 

The objective is to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

To understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default and utilise this for  portfolio and risk assessment. 


## Basic Understanding 

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

1) If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

2) If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

The data set contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The basic aim is to identify patterns in the data which indicate if an applicant is likely to default.

When a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company:

### Loan Accepted 

If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:

1) Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)

2) Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'.

3) Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan 



### Loan Rejected 
The company had rejected the loan because the candidate does not meet their requirements
